Home appears to be empty, no answer at the door.
After questioning neighbors, appears that the occupant may have left for a trip recently.
Considered a suspect until proven otherwise, but would have to eliminate other suspects to confirm.

Maher is not considered a suspect.  Video evidence confirms that she was away at a professional soccer game on the morning in question, even though it was a workday.

no further investigation due to no more proven clues, so far, Jeremy Bowers is the strongest suspect.
