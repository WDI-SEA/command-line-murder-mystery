//my notes 

head -n 20 people to poke around files
grep CLUE crimescene -search for clues in crimescene
use head on files like people and vehicle to track down address-potentialwitness
grep Annabel in people
head -n 173 streets/Mattapan_Street | tail -n 1  interview 2 possible witness by reading correct line from the streets they live on
grep honda vehicles, blue vehicles, l337 vehicles, use head on files to investigate structure
need multiple lines around each math, use -ABC option with grep, grep -A 5 "L337" mystery/vehicles
check member of several groups by combining lists, cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep "John Smith", -c will provide number of matches, or pipe result to wc -1
