The murderer is Jeremy Bowers.

I used grep on the crimescene to search for CLUE.
I used grep on people to search for Annabel.
I found the interviews for each annabel by using
head -n 173 streets/Mattapan_Street | tail -n 1.

I then used grep to search for blue hondas with correct license
grep -A 5 "L337" vehicles.

I looked through the results for a male driver over 6 feet and came up with 2 suspects. 

I then used grep to search the membership files for AAA, Delta_Skymiles, Library, and Museum.

Only Jeremy Bowers had memberships in all 4.
