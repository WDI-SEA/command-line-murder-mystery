The killer is Jeremy Bowers. Dirty scoundrel!

How I got there:
#
Searched for CLUE with:
grep -w "CLUE" crimescene

Found:
CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is a tall male, at least 6'.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.
#
Searched people file for Annabel with:
grep -w "Annabel" people

Found:
Annabel Sun	F	26	Hart Place, line 40
Oluwasegun Annabel	M	37	Mattapan Street, line 173
Annabel Church	F	38	Buckingham Place, line 179
Annabel Fuglsang	M	40	Haley Street, line 176

We know that the person leaving the coffee shop just before the shots were fired was a female with blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent. That leaves us with 2 of the 4 Annabels based on gender alone. Annabel Sun and Annabel Church.

Searched for interviews in the streets file

Annabel Church:

#
Reviewed interviews with Sun and Church

Sun:
cat interview-47246024
"Ms. Sun has brown hair and is not from New Zealand.  Not the witness from the cafe."

Church:
cat interview-699607
"Interviewed Ms. Church at 2:04 pm.  Witness stated that she did not see anyone she could identify as the shooter, that she ran away as soon as the shots were fired.

However, she reports seeing the car that fled the scene.  Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with "L337" and ends with "9""
#
Performed "cat vehicles" to see how the file was sorted. Performed:
grep -i "L337." vehicles
to search for plates matching the description from Ms. Church. Found a list of plates, but no names. That was silly of me. Peformed a search to include lines surrounding the plates to include owner information:
grep -A 5 "L337." vehicles

Found the following vehicles that match plates and a blue Honda belonging to a male that is at least 6' tall:

License Plate L337DV9
Make: Honda
Color: Blue
Owner: Joe Germuska
Height: 6'2"
Weight: 164 lbs

License Plate L3375A9
Make: Honda
Color: Blue
Owner: Jeremy Bowers
Height: 6'1"
Weight: 204 lbs
#
From there, I searched all membership files for each name to match the found cards to the suspects.

Joe:
cat AAA Delta_SkyMiles Museum_of_Bash_History Terminal_City_Library | grep "Joe Germuska"
Turned back Joe's name twice out of 4 membership lists.

Jeremy:
cat AAA Delta_SkyMiles Museum_of_Bash_History Terminal_City_Library | grep "Jeremy Bowers" 
Turned back ALL 4 membership lists meaning he is a match for the wallet found at the crime scene!
