To find a matching license plate, or a matching car, you can use grep on the 'vehicles' file:

	grep "Honda" vehicles

	grep "Blue" vehicles

	grep "L337" vehicles

This doesn't give us anything useful - why not? Try using 'head' on the file to investigate its structure.


Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with "L337" and ends with "9")
