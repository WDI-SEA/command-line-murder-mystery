Try poking around what's in a file by using the 'head' command:

  head -n 20 people

This will show you the first 20 lines of the 'people' file.


------ 
To go to the street someone lives on, use the file
for that street name in the 'streets' subdirectory.
To knock on their door and investigate, read the line number
they live on from the file.  If a line looks like gibberish, you're at the wrong house.
