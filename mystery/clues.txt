CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is at least 6' tall.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a person left right before they heard the shots. The name on their latte was Annabel, they had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.

Home appears to be empty, no answer at the door.

After questioning neighbors, appears that the occupant may have left for a trip recently.

Considered a suspect until proven otherwise, but would have to eliminate other suspects to confirm.
