I used grep to find the clues within the crimescene notes. I used touch to create my own clues file where I started to compile all of the clues I came across in one place. I used cd to navigate between folders and cat | grep to locate the parts of the files I was looking for. 
Grep came in handy to locate all of the blue hondas with L337 in the plate, and the names and heights of their owners. Once I had all of the tall male owners of Blue hondas, I located those names on the membership lists for AAA and Delta Skymiles. Only Jeremy Bowers had both memberships. After looking up his address, it appears he is the killer. 
2. The killer is Jeremy Bowers.
