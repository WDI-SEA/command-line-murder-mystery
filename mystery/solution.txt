The Killer's name is: JEREMY BOWERS


To find the clues at the crime scene, I used
560  grep "CLUE" crimescene
And I copied them to solution.txt with
561  grep "CLUE" crimescene > solution.txt

Looked at the structure of the people file with
 622  head -n 20 people
And found the Annabels with
  624  grep "Annabel" people

Moved to streets
  626  cd streets

Found interview hash in file
  642  cat Buckingham_Place

Cd to interview file and found the related interview
646  cat interview-699607

Added additional info to solution.txt
648  echo "Interviewed Ms. Church at 2:04 pm.  Witness stated that she did not see anyone she could identify as the shooter, that she ran away as soon as the shots were fired.\n\nHowever, she reports seeing the car that fled the scene.  Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with "L337" and ends with "9"%" >> solution.txt

  651  grep "L337" vehicles
But that didn't do any good

To see the structure of vehicles
  652  head -n 20 vehicles

***flailed a bit***

Learned about grep-C
  709  grep -C 5 "L337" vehicles
  710  touch suspects.txt
  711  grep -C 5 "L337" vehicles > suspects.txt

Identified matches from suspects.txt
  715  cd memberships

Checked relevant memberships
730  grep "Schooling" delta.txt
  731  grep "Schooling" Delta_SkyMiles
  732  grep "Schooling" library.txt
  733  grep "Germuska" Museum_of_Bash_History
  734  grep "Germuska" museum.txt
  735  grep "Germuska" library.txt
  736  grep "Germuska" AAA
  737  grep "Germuska" Delta_SkyMiles
  738  grep "Germuska" delta.txt
  739  grep "Germuska" museum.txt
  740  grep "Bowers" AAA
  741  grep "Bowers" delta.txt
  742  grep "Bowers" Delta_SkyMiles
  743  grep "Bowers" library.txt
  744  grep "Bowers" museum.txt

Nailed him!
  747  echo "The Killer's name is: JEREMY BOWERS" >> solution.txt




CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is a tall male, at least 6'.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.
Interviewed Ms. Church at 2:04 pm.  Witness stated that she did not see anyone she could identify as the shooter, that she ran away as soon as the shots were fired.

However, she reports seeing the car that fled the scene.  Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with L337 and ends with 9%
