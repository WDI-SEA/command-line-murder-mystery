"Interview" the two possible witnesses by reading the correct line from the streets they live on:
Annabel Sun SEE INTERVIEW #47246024
Oluwasegun Annabel SEE INTERVIEW #9437737
Annabel Church SEE INTERVIEW #699607
Annabel Fuglsang SEE INTERVIEW #871877

	head -n 173 streets/Mattapan_Street | tail -n 1

This will give you just line 173 of Mattapan street, because it will take first 173 lines, and then take
the last line from those.
