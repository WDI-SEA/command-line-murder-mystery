To see who was a member of several different groups, you can combine their membership lists into one and search against that.

	cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep "Joe Germuska"

If you only want to see the number of matches, you can use grep's -c option (the c must be lowercase):

	cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep -c "Erika Owens"

Or you can pipe the result to 'wc -l':

	cat Delta_SkyMiles Terminal_City_Library Museum_of_Bash_History | grep "Jeremy Bowers" | wc -l

Joe Germuska - 1
Jeremy Bowers -4
Jacqui Maher - 2

Erika Owens - 0
